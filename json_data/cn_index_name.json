  "body_head" : ["Hello, Steemians! I was fascinated by Crypto when i first read bitcoin whitepaper mid 2017, and has been investing on Crypto as many of you do. <br/><br/> And as a developer as well as an investor, i wanted to share some of the information(or indicators) which helps me decide when and what to buy. I made this daily to reduce my time watching price chart and indicators all day long, and rather use my time more productive and entertaining. Hope this post be of help!! &#128521; <br/><br/>(This report will be updated on daily basis.)<br/><br/><br/>"
